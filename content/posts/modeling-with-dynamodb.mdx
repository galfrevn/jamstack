<CustomLink href='https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/'>Amazon Web Services (AWS) DynamoDB</CustomLink>
is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance
with seamless scalability. In this blog post, we will discuss how to model an AWS
DynamoDB table for a **fully scalable and flexible chat application**.

Sound good? Let's get started.

<PostSubtitle id='chat-requirements' label='Requirements' />

Before diving into the DynamoDB table design, let's first establish the requirements for a chat application.
These requirements will help guide our table design and ensure that we are building a scalable and flexible system.

- Users should be able to **send and receive messages** in **real-time**.
- Messages should be **persisted and retrievable** for future reference.
- Users should be able to retrieve their **chat history**.
- The system should be able to **handle a large number of users and messages without compromising performance**.
- The system should be able to **scale seamlessly as the user base** and message volume grows.

<PostSubtitle id='designing-table' label='Designing the Table' />

To design a DynamoDB table for a chat application, we need to consider the access patterns of our application.
Access patterns refer to the ways in which we will be accessing the data stored in our DynamoDB table.
Here are the access patterns for our chat application:

- Retrieve **chat history** for a user
- Retrieve **all messages in a chat room**
- Retrieve **all messages sent by a user in a chat room**
- Retrieve **all messages received by a user in a chat room**

With these access patterns in mind, we can design our DynamoDB table as follows:

<PostMiniTitle id='primary-key' label='Primary key' />
The primary key of our DynamoDB table should be a composite key consisting of a partition
key and a sort key. The partition key should be unique for each chat room, and the
sort key should be a timestamp of when the message was sent. This will allow us to
retrieve all messages in a chat room sorted by the time they were sent.

<PostMiniTitle id='attributes' label='Attributes' />
Our DynamoDB table should have the following attributes:

- **chatRoomId**: The ID of the chat room
- **messageId**: A unique identifier for the message
- **senderId**: The ID of the user who sent the message
- **recipientId**: The ID of the user who received the message (if applicable)
- **timestamp**: The timestamp of when the message was sent
- **messageText**: The content of the message

<PostMiniTitle id='secondary-indexes' label='Secondary Indexes' />
We can create secondary indexes to support the remaining access patterns of our chat
application. Here are the secondary indexes that we will create:

- **userChatIndex**: This index will allow us to retrieve all messages sent or received by a user in a chat room. The partition key of this index will be the user ID, and the sort key will be the chat room ID.
- **chatRoomIndex**: This index will allow us to retrieve all messages in a chat room. The partition key of this index will be the chat room ID, and the sort key will be the timestamp.

<PostSubtitle id='accessing-data' label='Accessing Data in the Table' />
With our DynamoDB table design in place, we can now start accessing data in our table
to implement the chat application's features.

```ts showLineNumbers title="create-chat-conversation.ts"
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';

const client = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

export const create = async () =>
  await client.put({
    TableName: 'table name goes here',
    Item: {
      pk: 'CONVERSATION#' + conversationId,
      sk: 'METADATA',
    },
  });
```

<PostMiniTitle id='chat-history' label='Retrieving Chat History for a User' />
To retrieve the chat history for a user, we can use the userChatIndex that we created.
We can query this index with the user ID as the partition key and the chat room ID
as the sort key. This will return all messages sent or received by the user in the
specified chat room.

<PostMiniTitle
  id='chat-messages'
  label='Retrieving All Messages in a Chat Room'
/>
To retrieve all messages in a chat room, we can use the chatRoomIndex that we created.
We can query this index with the chat room ID as the partition key. This will return
all messages in the specified chat room sorted by the time they were sent.

<PostMiniTitle
  id='user-sent-messages'
  label='Retrieving All Messages Sent by a User in a Chat Room'
/>
To retrieve all messages sent by a user in a chat room, we can again use the userChatIndex
that we created. We can query this index with the user ID as the partition key and
the chat room ID as the sort key. However, we need to apply a filter expression to
retrieve only messages sent by the user.

<PostMiniTitle
  id='user-messages'
  label='Retrieving All Messages Received by a User in a Chat Room'
/>
To retrieve all messages received by a user in a chat room, we can use the chatRoomIndex
that we created. We can query this index with the chat room ID as the partition key.
However, we need to apply a filter expression to retrieve only messages received
by the user.

<PostSubtitle id='conclusion' label='Conclusion' />
In this blog post, we discussed how to model an AWS DynamoDB table for a fully scalable
and flexible chat application. We first established the requirements for a chat application,
and then we designed our DynamoDB table to meet those requirements. We also discussed
how to access data in our DynamoDB table to implement the chat application's features.
By following the guidelines presented in this blog post, you can build a scalable
and flexible chat application that can handle a large number of users and messages.
