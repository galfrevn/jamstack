In a Next.js application I'm working on, I have an "admin" page, which lets me manage registered users:

<PostImage
  alt="Refreshing serverside props"
  src="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/_next/image/?url=%2Fimages%2Frefreshing-server-side-props%2Fuser-table.png&w=750&q=75"
  width="750"
  height="189"
  decoding="async"
  data-nimg="future"
/>

One of my favourite features about Next.js is that individual routes can opt-in to server-side rendering. While I tend to be a [pretty big advocate](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs) for static generation, this is a perfect use-case for server-side rendering; I can fetch and inject the database data on first render, simplifying my front-end code.

At least, that's what I thought… And then I hit a snag. 😬

Here's my problem: in my dashboard, I'm able to edit users, to bestow purchases or update their name:

Notice how the updated name isn't shown in the table? This is because the page doesn't know that the underlying data has changed. After the page is server-rendered, those props are immutable.

How do we tell Next.js to re-fetch the data, on demand, without doing a hard refresh of the whole page?

In this short tutorial, I'll share the Nifty Trick I learned to solve this problem. We'll also learn how Next.js works under-the-hood, and cover a couple related problems + solutions.

Allons-y!\*

Here's the solution, for busy beavers looking for a copy-paste win:

```js showLineNumbers
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
function SomePage(props) {
  const router = useRouter();
  // Call this function whenever you want to
  // refresh props!
  const refreshData = () => {
    router.replace(router.asPath);
  };
}
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // Database logic here
}
```

The refreshData function would be called whenever you want to pull new data from the backend. It'll vary based on your usecase. As an example, here's how you'd refresh the data right after modifying a user:

```js showLineNumbers
async function handleSubmit() {
  const userData = /* create an object from the form */
  const res = await fetch('/api/user', {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify(userData),
  });
  // Check that our status code is in the 200s,
  // meaning the request was successful.
  if (res.status < 300) {
    refreshData();
  }
}
```

But why does this work? Why are we involving the router in this process, and what the heck is it doing?

In fact, this solution requires a bit of context-setting. Let's talk a bit about how server-rendered routes have a secret alter-ego 🦸🏾‍♀️
