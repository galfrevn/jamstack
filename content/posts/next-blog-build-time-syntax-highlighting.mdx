If you're writing about code, your blog probably needs...

- Syntax highlighting so your code blocks are **easier** for readers to parse
- Line numbers so you can reference the code you're discussing
- Line highlighting so you can draw **attention** to specific parts of code
- Block titles so you can add additional context
- You'd probably want colors that matched your website, right? What if you could use absolutely any VS Code theme?
- Oh, and you'll need light and dark mode of course, because of reasons
- And wouldn't it be great if you could do this without any runtime performance costs?

Sound good? Let's get started.
