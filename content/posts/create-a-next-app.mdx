If you’re looking to build a website using Nextjs and MDX files you’ve come to the right place.

In this guide you’ll mainly be focusing on the sourcing of data and learning how **[Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer)** works rather than how to make a pretty looking website.

## **What is Contentlayer?**

> Note: Contentlayer still in development and some APIs might change!

**[Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer)** turns your content into data - making it super easy to import MD(X) and CMS content in your app.

You can find the [full documention for Contentlayer here](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs).

I'm looking forward to seeing the adoption of Content Layer as it will be on stable version.

```ts showLineNumbers title="multiply.js" {3}
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
multiply(2, 2); // 4
```

Ok, now create this function

```ts showLineNumbers title="_app.ts" {36}
import "styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";

// Routing & Layout
import Router from "next/router";
import Layout from "layouts";

// NProgress bar
import NProgress from "nprogress"; //nprogress module
import "nprogress/nprogress.css"; //styles of nprogress
import { AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion";

//Binding events.
NProgress.configure({
  showSpinner: false,
  easing: "ease-out",
  trickle: false,
  speed: 300,
});
Router.events.on("routeChangeStart", () => NProgress.start());
Router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", () => NProgress.done());
Router.events.on("routeChangeError", () => NProgress.done());

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <AnimatePresence>
      <Layout>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Layout>
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
